# Learning Shader Programming

Repo of the stuff I did when exploring writing Shaders using OpenGL/GLSL with C/Raylib. Uses [noob build system](https://github.com/nailuj05/noob)

## Basic

In here you can find some basic shaders I wrote to get started, learning the different functions and how to use them.

## Masks

Here I experimented with some simple masking for images (like a GPU-accelerated graphics program) - became [TruMasker](https://github.com/nailuj05/tru-masker)


## Game of Life

Game of Life implemented using a shader operating on 2 swapped Buffers (not really optimized though)

## Noise

White Noise, Perlin Noise, Voronoi Noise functions, fractal Brownian Motion and Domain Warping for some cool effects.
